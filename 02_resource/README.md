# Resource: Allele-specific landscape throughout mouse lifespan
To interactively access the resource generated by *Hoelzl S. et al.*, please click on the following links for the organ of interest.
The allele-specific landscape will be displayed via the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)[^1]. Moreover, JSON files can be downloaded from the resource folder and loaded as *Session* from within the [IGV browser](https://igv.org/app/). Description of the individual tracks can be found in the example section.

| Track      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Refseq Curated | RefSeq gene annotation |
| Embryonic_Kidney_unstranded_total| Unstranded non-allele-specific RNA-seq track of one representative example replicate out of three |
| Embryonic_Kidney_fwd_allele-specific | Forward strand RNA-seq track obtained of a representative example replicate. Allele-specific reads are shown for the maternal BL6 allele (active X chromosome) in black and the paternal CAST allele (inactive X chromosome) in orange |
| Embryonic_Kidney_rev_allele-specific | Reverse strand RNA-seq track obtained of a representative example replicate. Allele-specific reads are shown for the maternal BL6 allele (active X chromosome) in black and the paternal CAST allele (inactive X chromosome) in orange |
| Embryonic_Kidney_AllelomePRO.bed | Alleleome.PRO2 bed output summarizing three replicates and naming the locus, the min. total number of SNP-overlapping reads within the gene body and the median allelic ratio. The color denotes the allelic bias (for X-linked genes: dark red: maternal (AR > 0.9), green: biallelic (0.9 >= AR > 0.15), blue: paternal (AR <= 0.15); for autosomal genes: dark red: maternal (AR >= 0.85), light red: towards maternal (0.85 > AR >= 0.65), green: biallelic (0.65 > AR > 0.35), light blue: towards paternal (0.35 >= AR > 0.15), blue: paternal (AR <= 0.15)) |
| Sequencing tracks are displayed for the following time points: Embryonic (E14.5), Young (4 weeks of age), Adult (9 weeks of age), Aged (1.5 years of age) |
