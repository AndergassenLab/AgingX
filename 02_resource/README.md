# Resource: Allele-specific landscape throughout the mouse lifespan
To interactively access the resource generated by *Hoelzl S. et al.*, please click on the following links for the organ of interest.
The allele-specific landscape will be displayed via the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)[^1]. Moreover, JSON files can be downloaded from the resource folder and loaded as *Session* from within the [IGV browser](https://igv.org/app/). A description of the individual tracks can be found in the example section.

| Track      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Refseq Curated | RefSeq gene annotation |
| SNPfile_C57BL_6NJxCAST_EiJ.bed | Single nucleotide polymorphisms between C57BL_6NJ (BL6) and CAST_EiJ (CAST) mouse strains used for allele-specific read assignment |
| Embryonic_Kidney_stranded| Stranded non-allele-specific RNA-seq track of one representative example replicate. The color and direction denote the strand information: forward strand: black upwards, reverse strand: grey downwards |
| Embryonic_Kidney_unstranded_maternal_BL6_Xa | Maternal BL6 unstranded RNA-seq track shown in red obtained of a representative example replicate. X-linked reads derive from the maternal BL6 active X chromosome. |
| Embryonic_Kidney_unstranded_paternal_CAST_Xi | Paternal CAST unstranded RNA-seq track shown in blue obtained of a representative example replicate. X-linked reads derive from the paternal CAST inactive X chromosome. |
| Embryonic_Kidney_AllelomePRO.bed | Alleleome.PRO2 bed output summarizing three replicates, naming the locus, the min. total number of SNP-overlapping reads, and the median allelic ratio. The color denotes the allelic bias (for X-linked genes: dark red: maternal (AR > 0.9), green: biallelic (0.9 >= AR > 0.15), blue: paternal (AR <= 0.15); for autosomal genes: dark red: maternal (AR >= 0.85), light red: towards maternal (0.85 > AR >= 0.65), green: biallelic (0.65 > AR > 0.35), light blue: towards paternal (0.35 >= AR > 0.15), blue: paternal (AR <= 0.15)) |<br/>
  
  Sequencing tracks are displayed for the following time points: Embryonic (E14.5), Young (4 weeks of age), Adult (9 weeks of age), Aged (1.5 years of age)

  X-linked genes that escape X chromosome inactivation are characterized by an allelic ratio ≤ 0.9. Unlike silenced X-linked genes, which exhibit only expression from the maternal active X chromosome (red RNA-seq peaks), escape genes also show expression from the paternal inactive X chromosome (blue RNA-seq peaks).

| Adult_Kidney_ATAC_total| Overlayed total ATAC-seq peaks retrieved from two replicates |

| Adult_Kidney_ATAC_AllelomePRO.bed |  ATAC Alleleome.PRO2 bed output of two replicates, naming the locus, the total number of SNP-overlapping reads, and the allelic ratio. The color denotes the allelic bias: <img width="238" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dae02a62-3e3e-4d72-829d-c1b4aca68282" /> |
| Adult_Kidney_RNA_AllelomePRO.bed | RNA Alleleome.PRO2 bed output summarizing three replicates, naming the locus, the min. total number of SNP-overlapping reads, and the median allelic ratio. The color denotes the allelic bias (for X-linked genes: dark red: maternal (AR > 0.9), green: biallelic (0.9 >= AR > 0.15), blue: paternal (AR <= 0.15); for autosomal genes: dark red: maternal (AR >= 0.85), light red: towards maternal (0.85 > AR >= 0.65), green: biallelic (0.65 > AR > 0.35), light blue: towards paternal (0.35 >= AR > 0.15), blue: paternal (AR <= 0.15)) |<br/>
